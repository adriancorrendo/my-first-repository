## 00. Quarto 🥶

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## 01. Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:
### a. code
```{r}
1 + 1
```

### b. extras
You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

### c. more extras
with your keyboard you create a code chunk using the combination: "Ctrl + Alt + I" (Windows) or "Cmd + Option + I" (Mac).
```{r}
print("Hello Quarto World!")
```
